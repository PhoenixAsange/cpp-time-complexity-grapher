<hr/>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
This tool helps benchmark the runtime of C++ functions by executing them multiple times at increasing iteration counts. 
It interpolates between <code>1</code> and a user-defined maximum, recording how execution time scales with input size.
The data is visualized using Python's <code>matplotlib</code> to generate clean performance graphs.

<h2>Future Improvements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Automation:</strong> The tool has multiple areas that can be automated.
